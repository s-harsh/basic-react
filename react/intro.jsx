// React makes building complex interractive and reactive user interfaces 

/* Build something with React you won't focuse on all the nitty-gitty
detials and it will be less error prone, because you become able to focuse
on your core business logic that makes up your application
intead of having to focus on the actual steps of updating the page 
when something happens somewhere.
That's why we use libraries like React
React embraces a concept called components. React is all about 
components. Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of coponents.
Components are resuable building blocks in your interface, they are in the end
just a combination of HTML code,CSS code for styling & possibly 
JavaScript code for some logic.
COmponents advantages -
1. Reusability reduce reputation 
2. Separation of Concerns - Don't do too manu things in one & the same place


React allows you to create re-usuable and reactive acomponents consisting of
HTML and JavaScript(and CSS).
React use Declarative Approach for building these components means define the
desired target state and let React figure out the actual JavaScript DOM instructions.

Nodejs all javascript code outside of the browser, it is not something at all in 
React, becauuse React code is js code that runs in the browser.
We need nodejs for this Create React App tool.

NPM - Node Package Manager
NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. It is the default package manager that comes
with NodeJS when you install it.
ReactJS uses Node.js a JavaScript runtime, to build your JacaScript code.
Basically the ReactJS is a JavaScript framework which needs the help of nodejs and npm
to tell the native side(Android/iOS) that these are packages I need to run my app
And it adds all the dependencies needed to run the app.

Bacially you don't need node.js to use React on the client side
