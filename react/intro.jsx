// React makes building complex interractive and reactive user interfaces 

/* Build something with React you won't focuse on all the nitty-gitty
detials and it will be less error prone, because you become able to focuse
on your core business logic that makes up your application
intead of having to focus on the actual steps of updating the page 
when something happens somewhere.
That's why we use libraries like React
React embraces a concept called components. React is all about 
components. Because all user interfaces in the end are made up of coponents.
Components are resuable building blocks in your interface, they are in the end
just a combination of HTML code,CSS code for styling & possibly 
JavaScript code for some logic.
COmponents advantages -
1. Reusability reduce reputation 
2. Separation of Concerns - Don't do too manu things in one & the same place
3.
